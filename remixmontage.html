     <p>My montage is supposed to portray the fact that videogames and the internet in general have become a means for individuals to put up a front one way or another. This is extremely evident in videogames from what I've personally experienced. Players are prime examples of people trying to act tough because they know for a fact that it won't come with any consequences. Personally, on called League of Legends and PUBG, I've heard people throw around so many racial slurs and hateful terms towards each other that it makes me sick. Everything that these players say have the potential to hurt the feelings of LGBTQ people, women, African-Americans, lower class citizens, and religious people. Players call each other gay, f*ggots, trash, crackers, and even n*ggers. This kind of language literally makes me unable to enjoy the games any more. And in general, these terms can drive people to engage in self harm or even suicide, which is why I consider it cyberbullying. All of the people that can be affected by this disgusting behavior are on the right. The swatstika on the player's headset is the reason I think these players have the nerve to say these hateful things nowadays. I firmly believe that the recent events with Charlottesville and others are bringing out the ugly in a lot of people because the toxicity was never this bad before. Just to recap, my montage is about the gaming community taking these hateful terms lightly and throwing them in each others' faces without realizing that these words can affect certain groups of people. </p>
