     <p>This project wasn't particularly new to me as I have used the Photoshop program before. I used photoshop and lightroom in a photography class that I took in high school, so I was pretty familiar with cropping, cleaning, and combining images that are taken from the internet or from my phone. However, this project did serve as a reminder of how much I miss using photoshop to edit and manipulate pictures because I love photography and post-processing is a very big part of that.</p>
