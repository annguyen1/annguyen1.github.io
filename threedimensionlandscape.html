     <h1>3D Landscape</h1>

     <p>Going into college, I never would have thought that I would be able to do anything as big as 3D printing. Prior to taking this class, I thought that 3D printing was only used for crazy advanced project like buildings or prosthetics or robotics. Never in a million years would I think artists could use 3D printing as a tool for expression.</p>
